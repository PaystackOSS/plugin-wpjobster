## :warning: **Deprecation Notice**

We regret to inform you that the Paystack WP Jobster Plugin is now deprecated and will no longer be actively maintained or supported.

**Reasons for deprecation**:
- Compatibility issues with the latest software versions
- Security vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed sufficiently.
- Obsolete functionality that is no longer relevant

To ensure a seamless experience, we recommend exploring the Paystack Integrations Directory for [alternative plugins](https://paystack.com/gh/integrations?category=cart#:~:text=Online-,Store,-Site%20Builder) that are actively maintained and supported.

## Installation 

### Minimum Requirements

* Confirm that your server can conclude a TLSv1.2 connection to Paystack's servers. More information about this requirement can be gleaned here: [TLS v1.2 requirement](https://developers.paystack.co/blog/tls-v12-requirement).
* At least version 4.0.0 of the WPJobster theme

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WPJobster Paystack Gateway, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WPJobster Paystack Gateway” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our payment plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our payment plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
